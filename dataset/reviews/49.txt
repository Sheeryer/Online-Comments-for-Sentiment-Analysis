I have 2 phone numbers with Metro PCS so I bought this with the intention of only using 1 phone for both numbers.  It worked, however, the reception was extremely poor for both of the sim cards.  I contacted customer support and they walked me through steps such as ensuring the wifi calling feature was turned off, but the reception never improved.  I removed one of the sim cards to see if the phone would operate better with only 1 sim but no luck.  It wasn\'t uncommon to not receive calls due to this issue.  I also had problems with the camera not focusing properly.  Overall, very disappointed with this phone and would not recommend to others.  I\'m going back to 2 phones since having good reception and solid data transfer is more important than the inconvenience of 2 separate phones.  Also, this is not the same version of the phone that MetroPcs sells as theirs does not have dual sim capabilities.\n
