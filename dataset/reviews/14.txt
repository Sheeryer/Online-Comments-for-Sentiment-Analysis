I like everything except I wish it had fingerprint. Face recognition is so annoying!  Very fast processor but the wifi does not seem to stay connected and my Ring doorbell app does not give me notifications on this phone for some reason. If anyone else had that problem and has fixed it please help me. My doorbells seem useless now.\n
