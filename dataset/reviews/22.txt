This phone was bought for my niece,  she took it to Verizon to set it up,  they could not  , At&t could not, Walmart could not.  I called Amazon,  they didn\'t know what to do.  She transferred to Samsung agent,  she took numbers and said it isn\'t made to sell in USA.  I could send back to Amazon,  my niece had connected with internet at home and had some apps she would use as a tablet,  that is an expensive tablet.  These things should be checked before taking someones money for something they can\'t use.  A fire tables would have been a better price.\n
