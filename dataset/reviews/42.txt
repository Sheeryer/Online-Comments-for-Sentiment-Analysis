This phone due to it not having buttons in the screen itself, you have to press the side button to start it . However, it is very easy to use and has cool features that I did not expect, such as pretty hood camera ( just like the iPhone x) , also light, but sturdy and looks expensive and sleek. The sound is super loud, like when talking in the phone and listening to a video. Overall, I think is a steal for the price.\n
