I rarely review my Amazon purchases. After being scarred by my galaxy s8, I almost switched to LG. But my s8 crashed last night and I busted out this back up phone I bought 3 months ago. I have faith in humanity again. It worked better than the s8 in downloading my backed up files. Why are cheaper and older phones better than the new ones. Also, kudos to seller. Nice package with pin, sd cards etc\n
