So far very happy with it and took $5 sim card and local store had us going in 20 minutes. If any problems will change review. This one was for my wife and tempted to buy another as far better than the one I have and her old one. Some of the bad reviews are wrong. It is  AT & T  is running on AT & T and is unlocked. May be the older ones had issues.\n
