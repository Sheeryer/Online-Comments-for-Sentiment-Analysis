I love this phone, it was well worth the money spent. The best points about the phone  are the  camera, the batery life and the storage. I would recomend this phone to anyone who doesnt want to spend upwards of 600$ on a new phone at the store, it was really simple to \xc3\xa7all AT&T to.get it switched over. Totally worth it !\n
