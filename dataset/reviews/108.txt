I needed a unlocked gsm to work on tracfone  (bring your own phone plan) since there is no verizon service in my area.  The sim card was only a dollar.  I typed the numbers in online, took the sim out of my old phone and the new one started working right away.  It works great.  It can hold a lot of apps.  I bought a microsd card.\n
