I bought this phone because i needed a phone that would do everything i wanted it to. it does that really well. its fast and the camera quality is superb.If you just need an extra phone for going out and about, its great.Howeverif you want to be able to call or text on this phone you cant because not only is the software not unlocked, it is LOCKED so you cant put a service provider on it without going to samsung, having them unlock it then going to your provider and haveing them update your phoneIts a great phone in terms of quality. but its two stars because of what i think is false listing on part of the seller.\n
