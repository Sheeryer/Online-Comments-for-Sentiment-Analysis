I was initially happy with this phone but after about 3 weeks it stopped working properly. Location wouldnt function, messages would not send properly. After going to my phone provider, they told menit is likely a locked phone and that is why all the issues are occurring. Unfortunately, amazon doesnt have the return option available for my order any longer and i cannot find how to contact seller. Waste of money and now have to buy another phone.\n
