Bought one for my mother in law, she loves it, looks alot more expensive than what it is and it works flawlessly.Update 8/19/19First one arrived perfect. I ordered a second one, box came open. The first one came with a 32gb free sd card, the second one someone took the sticker off the box, opened the box and removed the sd card, i have both boxes in front of me and the second one you can clearly see where they peeled the free 32gb sticker off the box, everything else was in the box though. I lowered my initial 5 star to a 3 star because of this shady business going on with the second phone.\n
