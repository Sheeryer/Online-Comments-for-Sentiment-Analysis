Great product, it shipped on time havent had any problems with it so far. I found it is straight talk compatible but only with a gsm straight talk nano sim card so be sure to check what network your sim works on before hand (unlike what i did), it is very easy and cheap to buy a different sim card tho. Great performance, good battery life, came without damages. Would buy again if i needed another phone.\n
