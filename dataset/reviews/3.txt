I needed to replace a older Samsung grand prime which only had 8 gb memory which sucked.  This phone was well packaged, and shipped promptly.  For me the features on this phone are quite good.  I have t=mobile service and all I did was put in the sim card from my old phone, and I was up and running receiving and making calls in 10 min.  the 32 GB memory is nice, and I received a 32 GB mini sd card with the phone also.  I refuse to spend 700 or more for a phone, or to pay 25.00 or more per month to rent one so this is a nice option.  My wife also needs new phone but wanted me to check this out before she buys.  so far I am pleased and I plan on buying one for her.Update. bought one for my wife.  Same as before, put in Sim card from old phone and she was up and running in 10 min.  after going through all settings.  As I stated we have T-Mobile and this phone works great. Has a large screen. I would buy from this seller again.\n
