it may be fine for someone that just wants to use as a phone but wifi card is not good and Bluetooth sucks, will not stay connected to my car at all I have had no problems with any phone hooking to my car but this one you have reset every time you kill the car,  it has just been a problem for day one I can get a cheaper phone that works better so I am done wasting time on one that does not work as I need it to\n
