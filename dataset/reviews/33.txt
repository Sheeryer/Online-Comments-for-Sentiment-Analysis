I like that this phone had the main feature I was looking for -- Battery life. The LG phone I had died before I arrived to work.  This meant I had to charge it practically all day to make it back home.  The Samsung phone made it all day on a single charge.  The negative factor is that the connectivity stinks!  I like to listen to music on my wireless devices -- good luck connecting using Bluetooth.  The WiFi connectivity also sucks.  My Fitbit does not connect either and connection to any other device is non-existent.  For this reason, I am ready to find the nearest trash can.  If I can make a 3 pointer to the can, I will feel like I have won somewhere.\n
