The phone is very basic but functions as needed most of the time. The camera doesn\'t focus well so most pictures are pretty lousy. My biggest complaint is that it was supposed to come with an addditional 32GB SD Card but did not. I contacted the seller over a month ago and have not gotten any response. Overall it was a waste of money when I should have purchased a Galaxy S6 Active on Amazon for just a little more.\n
