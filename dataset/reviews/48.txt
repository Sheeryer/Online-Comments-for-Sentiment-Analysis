I am not really picky about my phone. BUT .... (read until the end)This one has a really good price and features. So far I should be really happy, it is light, do all I need (I don\'t ask that much... call, text, whatsapp, fbk, instagram and take nice pictures)- face recogniztion is amazing! (I guess my son looks like me, because it works with him too).But when I received it and opened it, I found dust under the protection screen (the one you\'re supposed to remove for the first use....). The box was a little messy as well. So I am not sure that I received a brand new phone! (maybe someone returned it before).After only 1 week of use, I noticed that my phone just shut down for no reason (black screen)- the past 3 days. I tried to turn it on ( yes, using the right button), but nothing happens.. I have to wait 5 to 10 min before the screen comes back (pushing button and screen a hundred times..)I started the review when the screen got black.. I still can\'t use the phone.. hoping I will be able to use it quickly!(and yes I have 80% battery) or before I finish this review...CONCLUSION: It is nice and pretty and affordable! but after 1 week of normal use (and probably less than the average) I have issues with it. Is it the phone? Or the vendor who sell returned and defective products from other customer. Not sure..I don\'t know if I have to rate the phone or the vendor...I am pretty disapointed..\n
