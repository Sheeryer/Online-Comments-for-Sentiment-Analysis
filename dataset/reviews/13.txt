I\'ve just opened the phone. The phone is in Spanish and unable to change settings. As a matter of fact I am unable to move past the first set of instructions on the phone. This is either because the touch screen is not working properly.  I have no clue.  I\'m not just disappointed.  I am very mad. This phone is intended as a gift for my Mom. I planned to set it up first and then give it to her ....Now it\'s not ready and I will now need to go through the inconvenience of returning this item.  I don\'t even live in the United States. My friend was visiting the states and brought it down for me. Now I have to wait at least a month before I can return ship it, and in the meantime I\'m  down $138, plus I do not have the gift to give my mom now.  I\'m very disgusted.\n
