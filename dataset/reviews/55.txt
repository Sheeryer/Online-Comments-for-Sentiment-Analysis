Always been a huge fan of Samsung Galaxy so when my boyfriend was in the market for a new phone that\'s where we started. We were a little apprehensive of the reviews we had seen but decided to try it. It arrived in perfect brand new shape. Fully functional. We still need to activate it with a SIM card so when we have done that, I will update review. Until then, 5 stars!!Update!!So it turns out this is an international phone. We had to order a brand new SIM for it (we chose StraightTalk) and it is now active and working! If you choose to order this phone and wind up with an international phone you will need to tell StraightTalk customer service that it is an international phone or else they will act like it\'s a locked phone that you cannot use when actually all you need is a brand new SIM for only 99 cents!Final Words:Great phone.It works.No need for return.\n
