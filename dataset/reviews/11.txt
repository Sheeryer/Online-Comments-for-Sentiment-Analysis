This phone is even worse than the piece of trash I had before, some app settings are in Spanish I\'m paying for some security apps and can\'t transfer them over have to keep tapping the screen over & over and harder to get to screen I want it\'s not worth $1 let alone the $127 I paid I\'m very disappointed with the phone and with Amazon and tojo for the hard time I\'m getting trying to exchange it and it\'s only been 27 days I\'ve had it\n
