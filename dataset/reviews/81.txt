Phone is amazing so far..i had a note 5 since they came out loved that phone then it finally stopped working right so i was wanting to stay with Samsung...I have AT&T network all i did was put my sims card in and was working as soon as i turned phone on...great phone for the price and screen is alot bigger\n
