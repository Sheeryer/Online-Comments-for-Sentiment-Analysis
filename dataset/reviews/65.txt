I bought this phone, took it to Verizon to port my number and was told the phone was blacklisted. I then took it to metro and they used the second imei and ported my number. THREE DAYS LATER that IMEI  was black listed. I paid for the insuranceand I wanted Amazon to send a replacement but instead they are offering just a refund on the phone. Not the phone and the insurance. Not worth the headache. I now have to buy a new phone since I use my phone for work.\n
