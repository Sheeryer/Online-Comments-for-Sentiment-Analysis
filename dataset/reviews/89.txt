I\'ve only had this for about 20 days so I cant say much but so far I\'m happy with it. The color is beautiful (I got red) and the price is reasonable. So happy with the purchaseEDIT: I\'m so upset because this was initially so fast but a month into using it and its lagging so bad that it frustrates me. I\'m so disappointed now I was really hoping that this was gonna work for long but I guess not. Dont buy this.REVISED EDIT:it honestly isn\'t that bad. It has some slow moments but you get used to it after a while. If I had to go back in time i would definitely buy this again. The only reason I\'m giving it a 4 star is the horrible front camera.\n
