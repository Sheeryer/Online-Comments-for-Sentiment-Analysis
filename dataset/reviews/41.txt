This is a Great phone for the price.  It does great on battery.  The battery will last the entire day from morning to night and if you don\'t want to ruin the battery don\'t play games while its plugged in if the games normally drain the battery.  Its best to have it turned off at night once you put it kn the charger so you don\'t cause any issues with the battery.  The camera could be better but thats not what i got the phone for.  If you are getting this phone for the carrier Cricket, then yes it will work.  This phone does work with Cricket.\n
