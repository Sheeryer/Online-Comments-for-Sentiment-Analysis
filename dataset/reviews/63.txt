The screen cracked the same week I got this phone. I have been unable to get it fixed because no stores  have screens for this particular model. I cannot even find this model on the Samsung website. No one wants to buy it either because this model is virtually unknown. Now I\'m stuck with a broken phone with no hope of repair.\n
