I have had this phone for a few months. it was working fine until a week ago when my back and home button stop working randomly. when typing I have to hit the suggested words 2-4 times to make it type. when making phone calls sometimes it will go black or change to a different screen. I usually get a phone every few years since I take care of them. this one might not even last a year.\n
