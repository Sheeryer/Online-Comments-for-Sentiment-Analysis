You get what you pay for, plus a little more.Phone is reliable, and the battery lasts quite long. Only thing I dislike about this phone is how terrible the audio quality is, but that\'s the least of my problems, I am an avid headphone user anyway.Also the package was in Spanish, but that didn\'t affect anything.\n
