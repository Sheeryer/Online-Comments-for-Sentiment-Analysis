This is a great phone. It is definitely unlocked and worked right away after switching sim card. This phone is my first Samsung. I usually get HTC, but for the price and solid phone that this is, I just had to try it. Camera is great, Battery lasts me all day and night, great sound, and clear.I would highly recommend.\n
