Don\'t expect to be dissapointed by this kid to low range Samsung phone. I bought it for my wife and want an a20 or a30 now hehe. The design is plastic but beautiful, the screen is the for a phone I have seen for this price and the performance is what really blew me away for this price. Taps and swipes are fast and responsive. This was the first time I saw OneUI in action and really love the improvements Samsung made over their previous software. A definite buy for the value that you can get out of this more than capable phone. My only expected negative is the camera quality, which is pretty bad. But you can get some good shots in if you have good lighting and hold still!\n
