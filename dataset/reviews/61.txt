This phone is great for the money. After my father broke his phone, I bought him this phone as a form of upgrade from his ancient Note 4. The main thing i noticed after using it for 2 days myself is that occasionally from running many apps, it is a bit delayed to run system processes. I cannot really complain due to the fact that it does have 2 GB ram and i knew that well before i even purchased the phone.Great phone though! Props to Samsung.\n
