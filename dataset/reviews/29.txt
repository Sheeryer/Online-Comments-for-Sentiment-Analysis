I needed a feature-rich phone that would be capable of reliable use in Europe, and this fit the bill. I tried a Blu phone but the Wi-Fi ceased functioning not long after purchasing. Thankfully I was able to have this phone delivered before leaving. It\'s no race horse and certainly can\'t compete with higher priced android and apple offerings, but that is not its purpose.The phone takes good pictures, has good battery life, and the dual sim card feature is a plus.My only real gripe is that it doesn\'t have touch less pay, which is all over Europe. But then the phone would likely be more expensive.This also might work well as an internet access device.\n
