I love the size and capabilities of this phone! I haven\'t tried the fingerprint nor face recognition features, so I couldn\'t rate those. However, I gave it 4 stars because it doesn\'t stay charged as long as it should; I have to charge it twice a day. And, I don\'t like that I cannot change the battery...I mean, what do you do when the battery plays out? Otherwise, I love it!\n
