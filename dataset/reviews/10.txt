Bought my from lifeline786 for $126. Very fast delivery. I also got a sd card and head phones. Buy from these guys. Phone workimg just fine so far. No adaptable storage. The sd card is fast too. Camera is ok. Games are playable in low to medium quality. Nba 2k19 is playable in medium setting. Great phone for the value. Love it so far. But it. Screen is also bright. Dolby atmos is amazing. It has a eq also.\n
