Very fast delivery had within two days of order.  As stated this not for Verizon, Sprint or CDMA providers.  Words great with AT&T, had some issues with the sim card as I did not have a nano-sim. However, I visited my local AT&T store and they were able to help me by trimming my sim card down to fit it into the sim slot on the side of the phone.  The phone works great and just what I needed for a nice upgrade without spending 1000 dollars.\n
