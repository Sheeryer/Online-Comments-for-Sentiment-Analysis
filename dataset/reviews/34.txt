You will probably regret asking my opinion but here goes.....purchased this phone on line including an nice otterbox to match.  Got the phone and everything was in spanish, mexican or whatever.  I called Amazon, spoke with a rep, we laughed about it and she asked if I wanted to exchange it.  I said yes , for an E.NGLISH speaking one.  She said no problem.  Received the new phone a couple of days later.  Low and behold!  Another spanish speaking phone.  Couldn\'t even understand the instructions.  I was fairly livid at this point.  Had to mail both phones and otterbox back and wait for refunds.  Won\'t be buying another cell on line from Amazon.\n
