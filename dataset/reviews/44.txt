I absolutely love this phone! I waited to give a review so that I could give a true account of my purchase. I have been afraid to take the leap to buy a new phone as I use sim cards from non major carriers and have used an old galaxy primecore since 2016. With all the new phones out there, I was afraid but knew I needed to have at the very least 32G ( my last phone only had 8G)  The phone is absolutely beautiful! It\'s light it\'s display is incredible and the transferring from old to new phones was effortlessly done by the genius that samsung is. I have also used an LG G4 in the past and it burnt up inside.  So Samsung became my phone. This may seem like a simple phone to some but it\'s capable of so much and more than can be written in this review.  It\'s a perfect phone with dual sim ( the only difference I would make and perhaps it can occur maybe I just haven\'t found the correct way yet) but I would love to have both sims able to receive SMS messages on their own numbers.  Most of you won\'t be affected by this as you probably have unlimited SMS as most do these days.  I don\'t but it does have a forward feature for the SMS but that\'s not something I can personally choose. ( Because of my SIM cards.) You can receive calls on each number which is great and each can have it\'s own tone of course.  The camera is fabulous and I just can\'t express how happy I am with this phone! If you are feeling hesitant at all, don\'t worry this phone is everything you could want! I\'m over the moon about it! Thanks for reading, and I hope I helped sharing :) Metta\n
