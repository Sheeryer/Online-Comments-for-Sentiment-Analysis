Great phone for the price. I bought it to have a second phone for home business and for travel and so far its been doing well. Dual-sim allows me to keep my personal phone number and my business phone all on one phone. The micro-SD card allows me to store a crazy amount of fotos and other information. It is the international version, so Im able to travel to another country and use their sim cards for economical usage of my phone. Overall its excellent for the price point.\n
