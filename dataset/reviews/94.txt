So far I am really happy with this phone. Long battery life, lasts me all day and then some, and decent features. Signal strength isn\'t what my old phone was but it is still good. Bought phone because support for my windows phone is ending this year, I miss it. But I do love all the access to all the apps this phone offers.\n
