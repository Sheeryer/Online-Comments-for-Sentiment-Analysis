I honestly didnt want a Samsung phone. But buying this phone really help me not regret it. Its great, takes great pictures and its up to date. Dosent over use its battery power, althought thats if you dont spend on the phone all the time. My only problem is that it feels so fragile that if it where to fall down im sure something would shatter. So i would recomend buying a case and screen protector while buying this phone. Other then that, it seems very relaible.\n
