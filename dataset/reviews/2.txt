I was looking for a phone to replace my Samsung Galaxy on5 which only had 8GB of storage So I decided to look on here to find my new phone and I am so glad I did This phone has everything I was looking for I wanted a good size phone, storage, fast speed and a great camera and, Security features, and price Size 6.2 inches, fast Speed, Samsung Exynos 7 Octa 7884 Octa core Processor,and it runs on Android 9 Pie,Storage 32GB 2GB of Ram and came with a free 32GB SD card, Camera 13MP and 5MP, it doesn\'t come with a finger sensor to unlock it, It comes with face recognition which I think it\'s better than the finger print sensor , It works great with T-Mobile 4GLTE, A very great buy For $130I Edited this post because after a few days when I get incoming calls it makes weird noises and you can\'t hear the person  and have to hang up and call back, When you touch the screen it freezes at times and delays and gets warm when talking I had hopes for this phone begin a Samsung Galaxy, 3 stars I\'m returning it\n
