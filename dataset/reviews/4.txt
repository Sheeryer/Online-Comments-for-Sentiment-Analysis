My daughter picked out and payed for this phone herself.  It does not appear to be compatible with any service. I am completely devastated that Amazon would sell something that cannot be used.  I have ordered a SIM card so we shall see, but I am angry right now. I cannot find out if a phone is compatible unless I open it.\n
