One of the best phones I\'ve  ever used. Picture quality is fantastic, screen to bezel ratio is fantastic for the price, and battery life is phenomenal. As someone who uses bluetooth a lot to listen to music and podcasts while working, it\'s incredible to find a phone that last many days on a singular charge. That combined with quick charge makes all of it worth the price tag.\n
