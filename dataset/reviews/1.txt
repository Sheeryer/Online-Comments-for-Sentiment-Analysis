I had a Galaxy S8, which I accidentally broke. I liked the phone very much except the screen was smaller than I was used to.  Anyway, I looked at many phones, and finally decided to stay with Samsung.  I ordered the Galaxy  A10 because it appeared to have exactly what I want at a fraction of the cost.  I received the A10 three days ago, and I absolutely LOVE it!! Even more than the S8.  There is not one thing that I dislike about it. It was easy to set up. It\'s really fast, camera takes beautiful brilliant pics, and the screen size is perfect!! AND Breed included a 32GB SD card, which doubled the memory, at NO COST to me!! I would most definitely buy from Breed again, and highly recommend this company to everyone!!  Hope this review is helpful.  Sincerely, Tamara in Texas\n
