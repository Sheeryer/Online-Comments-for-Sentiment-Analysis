Pretty upset about this order. I ordered this because I broke my phone on deployment, and they wouldn\'t ship to an APO for starters. Also, when my wife received the box thank god she looked inside because there was no phone just a charging cable and headphones. So, now I\'ll just have to go even longer until I can get a replacement phone.\n
