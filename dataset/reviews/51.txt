I use Google maps constantly for work before with my galaxy s6 I never had an issue. This phone constantly drops calls and I\'m on the same network I had before. I have no service in places i had full service with my galaxy s6. I\'m going to have to buy a GPS because it constantly loses signal and never picks it back up. Also my texts dont go through sometimes so I\'m having to resend texts then he person gets them twice. It\'s not my network my daughter has a TCl cheap phone and she gets better service in the same room as me. So yeah it has great battery and the screen is big and clear but I need a phone and more importantly a GPS FOR WORK. Wish I would have sent it back before the window closed for returns.\n
