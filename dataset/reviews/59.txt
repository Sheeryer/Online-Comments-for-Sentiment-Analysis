Cool phone. Bought 2 and so far my husband and I are really enjoying them. I did have to purchase 2 nano sim cards because our other phone were micro sims, but they were not expensive at all . Instructions were the most thoughtful that i have ever seen. I would definitely recommend this product. Our phones were Straight Talk with a service plan already active. Surprisingly, the online transfer process was a breeze. Thanks a mil\n
