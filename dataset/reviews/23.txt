I am very skeptical of buying larger-ticket items on Amazon, not knowing if it\'ll be a ripoff or not, but I received this phone to replace my old busted one and I haven\'t had one single issue! It transferred over with my T-Mobile service with literally no issue and it works perfectly! I am so happy, thank you!Bailey\n
