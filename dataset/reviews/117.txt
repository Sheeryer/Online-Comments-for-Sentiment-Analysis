Everything works perfectly and it\xe2\x80\x99s very fast but the problem is that i use t-mobile and the wifi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work outside or sometimes it works but it\xe2\x80\x99s very slow. If you\xe2\x80\x99re someone that just wants to use it in the house or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care very much about internet then i recommend this phone but if you\xe2\x80\x99re like me and you\xe2\x80\x99re the kind of person that uses internet outside the house a lot then I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend it. I had to return it .\n
