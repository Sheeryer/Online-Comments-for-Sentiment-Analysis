I got this as a replacement for the fire phone that finally died in me.  While I found I missed having a pocket watch and the ability to text, I did not find I missed those things enough to pay $800 to regain them.  I was pleased to find this for under $150.  It was very easy to install the included memory card and my AT&T card (there is actually room for two of these), there was even an included took to pop out the tray.  The phone came partially charged, so fully charging it took a short time.  Set up was easy.  Default language was Spanish, but that was easy to change, and there are lots of options for non-Spanish speakers.  Miss the connectivity to my Kindle fire that I had with the Fire phone, but Amazon is out of the phone business so that is what it is.\n
