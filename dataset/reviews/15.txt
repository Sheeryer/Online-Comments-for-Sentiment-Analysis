This phone was everything I needed. The screen quality is immaculate and the overall performance gets two thumbs up and 5 five stars all across the board. It\'s been a while since I had a Samsung phone so it maybe the hype of getting one again but this satisfied quality and phone transfer with my company (Metro by Tmobile) was a piece of cake. I\'d recommend getting this phone to everyone. Delivery was on time and I\'m very very satisfied.\n
