I have had it for a month, 2 weeks after I received it I had problems with it charging I used the cord it came with. Stopped charging. Now it won\'t connect to my service provider. I installed a new SIM card & nothing. The picture quality is good but overall it\'s a cheap phone. Spend a little extra money and get something better.\n
